=== The generator has the following interface:

-h
	Help. The interface is displayed.

-v
	Verbose. Some additional information is displayed.

-t <template> a=<n>/<d> d=<n>/<d> tr=<threshold>
	Defines a context template. For example, "-t 1:6" creates a model
	that uses the last 6 bases for context. The model is updated only
	if it is used in the current block (i.e., if it was found to be
	the best model for that block). The "a=<n>/<d>" parameters are 
	optional, serving to set the alpha parameter of the probability 
	estimator in the trainning phase. The "d=<n>/<d>" parameters are 
	optional, serving to set the delta parameter of the probability 
	estimator in the generation phase. The "tr=<threshold>" parameter 
	is optional, serving to keep only the local statistics of the last 
	"<threshold>" symbols. Default <threshold> parameter use the whole
	past occurences of the sequence.
	For example, "-t 1:2 a=1/1 d=1/10 tr=500" means that the context is 
	the last two bases, the probability estimates of that model in the 
	trainning phase are computed using alpha=1, the probability 
	estimates of that model in the generation phase are computed using 
	delta=0.1, and the model only keep the statistics form the last 500 
	bases.

-u <template> a=<n>/<d> d=<n>/<d> tr=<threshold> (update always)
	The same as the "-t" flag, but in this case the model in the 
	trainning phase is always updated, even when it was not used in the 
	current block.

-bs <bSize> (default: 100 bases)
	The size of the block in number of bases.

-bts <bTableSize> (default: 10000 bases)
	The size of the block table (score matrix) that stores the number of 
	selections of a certain block size (variable) with a certain Markov 
	model.

-n <nGenSymbols> (default: number of base from the trainning file)
	The number of generated bases.

-o <genOutFile>
	If present, it writes the generated sequence in file "genOutFile".

-ic (update inverted complement repeats)
	Is an optional parameter. Uses the mechanism for updating also the 
	context corresponding to the inverted complement of the original 
	context.

-ns <nGenSequences> (Default: 1)
	Number of synthetic sequences to generate.

-s <seed> (default: TIME(NULL))
	Seed to initilize pseudo-random function.

-mc <maxCount> (default: 4294967295)
	Establishes the maximum value allowed in the context counters, which,
	by default, is the maximum capacity of the counters. When a counter
	reaches this value, all counters of the context are divided by 2.

-hs <hashSize> (default: 19999999)
	The size of the hash-table.
	
-conf <configFile>
	A configuration file with parameters. The '#' symbol in the beggining
	of the line will create an uninterpreted line (comment line).

-bInfo <blockInfoFile>
	A file with the block table (score matrix) information.

<dataFile>
	The trainning sequence file: a DNA sequence file in fasta or in gzip 
	fasta format.
